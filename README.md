# MoneyLion Internship Application - Mobile/Frontend

Hi Team! 👋

This is a custom-built React portfolio submitted as part of my application for the **Software Engineer Intern (Mobile/Frontend)** role at MoneyLion (Jan 2026).

**Live Demo:** [https://abdullamshv.github.io/moneylion-project](https://abdullamshv.github.io/moneylion-project)

## 🚀 Why I Built This
While my primary commercial experience (at FinFin) is in **Flutter**, I noticed your job description emphasizes **React** and **React Native**.

I built this site in **React + Tailwind CSS** over a weekend to demonstrate:
1.  **Adaptability:** I can pick up your web stack immediately.
2.  **Frontend Skills:** I understand component architecture, responsive design, and modern CSS.
3.  **Drive:** I don't just tell you I can do it; I show you.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React 19 (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** GitHub Actions / Pages
* **Icons:** Lucide React

## ⚡ Key Highlights (from my CV)
* **FinTech Experience:** Currently building real-time financial data apps at FinFin.
* **Performance:** Reduced mobile app load times by **30%** in my previous role.
* **Availability:** Ready to join the KL team starting **January 12th, 2026**.
